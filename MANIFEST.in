# We plan to store the full archive of a paper implemented in Econ-ARK
# separately from the codebase that reproduces the paper's results.

# At present we have not separated these things out for either the
# cAndCwithStickyE paper or the cstwMPC paper.
# Therefore those papers are left out in the current version.
